# Changelog

## 0.3.0
Security increased to further increase secrecy. When the spendInfoString is deterministic (or easily guessable) it's easy to see down the chain, meaning that old XSPOCT owners could see new owners address and when they spend it. Adding random data to the spendInfoString makes it impossible to determine who is spending the XSPOCT Note. 

## 0.2.0
Add XSPOCT arbitrary assets (tokens) to specification.

## 0.1.0
First version of XSPOCT.
